# Climate Analysis Script

This repository contains a Python script for climate analysis. The script is designed to analyze climate data, including temperature maxima (Tmax), temperature minima (Tmin), and the Excess Heat Factor (EHF), for the years 1983 to 2016. The analysis includes calculations of various climate indices and visualizations.

## Features

- Analysis of Tmax and Tmin data for the years 1983-2016.
- Calculation and visualization of the Heat Wave Duration (HWD), Heatwave Number, Excess Heat Wave Factor etc. using provided data.
- Calculation and visualization of EHF for the years 1983-2016.
- Efficient chunking of large datasets to prevent memory issues.

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the following requirements installed:
- Shell
- Climate Data Operatr
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (e.g., xarray, matplotlib, cartopy, xclimdex)
